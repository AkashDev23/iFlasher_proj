[Music]

do the rich people cringe and say don't

tell them that

yes yes yes don't tell people what they

what you know keep them poor

[Music]

my father was the head of education phd

all that stuff

i go home and ask him i said why don't

we learn about money in school

[Music]

and he looked at me he says because the

government doesn't let us teach that

subject

the government tells us what we can

teach and what we can't teach

and i thought that was strange and i

said but

aren't we going to school to learn about

money he says no

your job is to get a job i said but you

get a job to

earn money he goes no you're supposed to

just get a job

i'm like no no no no no isn't the

purpose of a job to earn money he goes

you're correct i said so why don't i

just learn about money

i can skip the job part you know and he

got flustered and he said

if you want to learn about money why

don't you ask your best friend's father

about money

and i said why that's mike so i asked

him

he says because mike's father is an

entrepreneur and i said what am

what are you he says i'm an employee i'm

a government employee

i went oh what's the difference

this is the difference is an

entrepreneur must know about money

or that they're no longer entrepreneurs

and it says an employee doesn't have to

know anything about money

because the government will take care of

the company will take care of them

so i'm kid i'm all confused but i took

my dad's advice and i

trundle over to mike's father's office

and knocked on his door and i said hey

i'm here nine years old

teach me about money he says beat it kid

you know

but that's what this toy of rich ted

poor dad started

and finally through persistence my rich

dad started teaching me about money on

one condition

and that condition was he would never

pay me

he says the moment i pay you you think

like an employee

he says that's the trap entrepreneurs

work for free

and now i'm nine years old my head's

going cracking in half

he says you never want a paycheck you

understand that kid

he said okay i got it and he said well

how do i make money he says

that's what entrepreneurs figure out

it's like

so how do i learn about money so he

would just break out a monopoly

game board so i would work for free and

pick up cigarette butts and

get hotels and restaurants and i would

clean and do menial tasks

and as i got older i started getting

into office work and marketing and

accounting and

i was an apprentice basically but i

always work for free

and he would teach me about money but

the way he taught me about money was

playing monopoly

and that's finally one day i got upset i

said well when are you going to teach me

about money he says

what do you think we're doing

[Music]

we're playing monopoly he goes no no no

no what do you think we're doing

we're playing monopolies what do you

think we're doing

cause i don't know i'm teaching about

money

and then that's when you have one

greenhouse you know he says

there's many formulas for great success

and money there's thousands of them

but one of the best ones founded on the

game of monopoly still is today

four greenhouses one red hotel

said what he says one of the greatest

ways to

acquire great wealth is playing monopoly

in real life four greenhouses one red

hotel

but is that all there is he goes that's

it

and he says what do you think i'm doing

and i went i don't know

so then he took me out he showed me his

greenhouses

and 10 years later when i was 19 i was

now in school in new york

and i come back to hawaii and rich dad

had bought

the biggest piece of land smack dab in

the middle of waikiki beach

and when you go to waikiki beach today

you'll see the hyatt regency hotel

that was his hotel just like the game of

monopoly just like the game of monopoly

acquired assets and they became bigger

assets he just kept

what's called an assemblage because that

property wasn't that big at the time so

you had to buy out all the small

guys because waikiki was a little dirt

about a little town

so he'd buy out this shop owner and buy

that shop owner

and it took him a while but he finally

assembled this large piece of property

and then he then he and hyatt

put up this giant hotel you know i just

and it just sold for 800 million dollars

so that's how i learned about money

[Music]

i've had financial crashes i've had

people stab me in the back

but they're all good because i grow from

it that's spirituality

you know people who are afraid of making

mistakes like they teach in school

they don't ever grow because

spirituality is there's good

and there's bad there's right and

there's wrong there's up and there's

down

most people don't want to be right they

only want to be positive

well you can't have that that's not

reality

well i wasn't poor by most people's

standards

but i came from a family with a poor

attitude if you know what i mean

because rich poor middle-class poverty

starts with

a fundamental attitude poverty is passed

on

it's taught in your families and middle

classes taught in families

and so the people right now who are

sitting at home

who are struggling financially or

worried about money or

unhappy they may be making a lot of

money but unhappy with what they're

doing

it was probably taught to you you know

your super ego was taught

get a job work hard or or you'll never

be rich or the rich or evil or

whatever the school system will never

teach you about money

the school system was designed to teach

you to be an employee

which is important or a doctor or a

lawyer

a specialist but never about money

and what most people lack is real

business knowledge

like accounting you know like debt like

taxes you gotta know that stuff but they

don't teach it in school to anybody

so and then when people ask me how did

your rich dad learn this

when your poor dad a page they didn't

and the answer is very simply my rich

dad was my best friend's father

his father died when he was 13. so

his so rich dad had this family business

at 13

to run so he had to drop out of school

which was his blessing you know those

blessings and

you know sometimes the blessing doesn't

look like a blessing but it turned out

to be a blessing

and then his teachers became his

bookkeeper his accountant his attorney

his

bankers his real estate agents so he has

what i call

real teachers not these fake teachers in

school

you see most teachers in school they're

out of ethics

they teach subjects they don't they

themselves don't practice

i asked the teacher i said you know i'm

in my third year of calculus now

it was called it was called strength of

materials

i said am i ever going to use this stuff

he goes

no you know he said

why do you teach it as i get paid

so do you ever use it he goes no

[Music]

and that's why you know i you have to in

life

one of the things i suggest to people

you got to find a real teacher versus a

fake teacher

and a fake teacher somebody doesn't do

what they teach

and a real teacher is doing what they

teach every day so my accountants

my attorneys they're in it every single

day that's how i learn because every day

i'm solving problems in my business

so i have i have accountants and

attorneys and bankers and all these

people on speed dial

because i'm i'm solving problems with my

team

i see you giving this knowledge out and

yeah do the rich people cringe and say

don't tell them that

yes yes yes don't tell people but they

what you know keep them poor

but you know unfortunately the poor as

was in the bible i'm not really

religious

the poor will always be amongst us

because it starts up here

right it's that fear mentality it's it's

in their words you know and the words

become flesh

i'm not really religious i flunked out a

sunday school also

but when they say i can't afford it or i

can't do that

they go down they become what they say

my phd daddy says what do you think i am

made of money

i can't afford that and my rich dad

would say

that's why he's poor poor people say i

can't afford it i can't do that i don't

have time

because this is escape it's an escape

you know i mean it's easy to say i can't

afford and your rich dad used to say

what

instead of i can't afford it how can i

afford it

how can i do that you know what would it

take or why should i do that

he says a question opens a mind a

statement closes the mind see when you

say i can't afford it

your mind shuts down and you become what

you say

rugby is a team sport but so is soccer

the roles are different

and other people are golfers they play

by themselves

and so everybody's different so my game

financially

is business number one second is real

estate

so what i say to young people is you

find your game

[Music]

[Music]

you
